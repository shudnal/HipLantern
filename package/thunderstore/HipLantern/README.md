![logo](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/headers/2741_1712869823.jpg)
Craft a little lantern and place it on your hip to cast away the darkness.

If you like darker nights you can also check [CircletExtended](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/shudnal/CircletExtended/) and [Firefly](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/shudnal/Firefly/) mods.

Must be installed on server in multiplayer.

You can change some item and light properties:
* crafting station
* light color
* light intensity, range and shadows strength (indoors and outdoors)

Item recipe is confurable: SurtlingCore x3, BronzeNails x10, FineWood x4.

It take it's own slot. That slot ID is configurable to avoid future incompatibilities.

The goal of the mod is to make fighting easier at dungeons or at night. Default light intensity is only good to barely see your enemy up close.

It serves the same purpose as the Hand Lantern in Bloodborne and Elden ring.

## Installation (manual)
extract HipLantern.dll folder to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder.
